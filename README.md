# BeyondMoore
_Pioneering the Future of Post-Moore Computing_

**BeyondMoore** addresses the timely research challenge of solving the software side of the Post Moore crisis. The
techno-economical model in computing, known as the **Moore’s Law**, has led to an exceptionally productive era for humanity
and numerous scientific discoveries over the past 50+ years. However, due to the fundamental limits in chip
manufacturing we are about to mark the end of Moore’s Law and enter a new era of computing where continued performance
improvement will likely emerge from **extreme heterogeneity**. The new systems are expected to bring a diverse set of
hardware accelerators and memory technologies.

## Projects

* [CPU Free Model](https://github.com/parcorelab/cpu-free-model): A Fully Autonomous Execution Model for Multi-GPU Applications that completely excludes The involvement of the CPU beyond the initial kernel launch.
* [CPU Free Infused Dace](https://github.com/parcorelab/dace): Dace Augmented with code generation that uses the CPU Free Model
* [Snoopie](https://github.com/parcorelab/snoopie): A Multi-GPU Communication Profiler and Visualiser
* [Multi-GPU Callbacks](https://github.com/msasongko17/multigpu_callback): (To be written)
* [Ilyas's CUDA Graph Work](https://github.com/msasongko17/multigpu_callback): (To be written)
